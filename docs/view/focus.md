# Focus view

Focus on an element, whether a node or edge.
The left column contains information about the element, while the flow window depicts its relations with neighbouring elements in the graph.

## Element-info pane

This pane contains the current version of an element (node or edge) and its properties.

* The *View* tab is opened by default and simply displays the latest pulled version of the element.
* The *Edit* tab allows one to edit the element properties
* The *History* tab displays the history of creation and edits for that node.

## Element-ratings pane

This pane presents the histograms of ratings for an element (e.g., support ratings for nodes), and allows logged-in users to enter or change their rating dynamically.


## Flow pane

This pane shows a subpart of the whole graph, with the currently selected element and its neighbours. It allows the user to view, select, create, move, connect elements.
