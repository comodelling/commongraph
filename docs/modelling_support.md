## Support ratings
Users are encouraged to voice their level of support for each potential change, through rating given nodes along a Likert scale of **1** (strongly disagree) to **5** (strongly agree).
Note that these ratings will be anonymous on the UI, and pseudo-anonymised in the database.
Further down the line, these ratings will then be used to estimate and debias an overall measure of support within every node's scope.
