# User's view

Users have the ability sign up (`/signup`) and log in (`/login`) using the log in interface, and update their preferences in their user settings (`/settings`).
A security question and answer can be set to be able to reset one's password.

By default, non-logged in users can also access and edit the graph.
However, logging in will unlock a few rights to users such as rating nodes, saving pages.
