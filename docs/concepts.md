# Graph and networks

Though ***graph*** and ***network*** may sometimes be used interchangeably, here we use *graph* to designate an **abstract structure or database** and *network* for an actual instance or implementation of a *graph*.
Furthermore, we will often use ***subnetwork*** to refer to actual subsets of a given network or graph database.


***Nodes*** or ***vertices*** are the main entries in a *graph*, which may be connected together by ***edges***.
Below we detail the various types of nodes and edges supported in ObjectiveNet.

# Nodes

## Potentialities

## Actions
Related terms: potential actions


Actions are to be understood as potential actions


## Objectives
Related terms: goals

# Edges

***Edges*** connect ***nodes*** together.
ObjectiveNet only defines two types of *edges*: ***conditions*** and ***implications***.

## Conditions
Related terms: conditions, or requirements


## Implications
Related terms: implications, or outcomes
